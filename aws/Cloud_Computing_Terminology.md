Cloud Computing = Application running on someone else's computer. <br>
The Cloud term refers to software and services running on the Internet, not locally on your computer. So you can store and access data and programs over the internet rather than hard drive of your computer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkx8Egjm2mw">IMPORTANT DATES</a> <BR>
The idea of cloud computing came in to picture(1970), Professor Ramnath Chellapha had mentioned the Cloud in an article(1997), Amazon Web Services(AWS) launched its puclic cloud(2002)

It's important to note that the terms cloud-native and cloud-agnostic are not mutually exclusive. Cloud-native describes where the software is designed to run, and cloud-agnostic describes the capacity for an organization to use different cloud providers instead of a single provider.

EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS's offering. EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud => Infrastructure as a Service. It mainly consists in the capability of:<br>
* Renting virtual machines(EC2)
* Storing data on virtual drives(EBS)
* Distributing load across machines(ELB)
* Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)<br>

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">Amazon EC2 pricing</a><br>
Amazon EC2 is free to try. There are five ways to pay for Amazon EC2 instances: On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances. You can also pay for Dedicated Hosts which provide you with EC2 instance capacity on physical servers dedicated for your use. For more information on how to optimize your Amazon EC2 spend, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/cost-and-capacity/">Amazon EC2 Cost and Capacity page.</a><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQANRLrdxvo"> Amazon EC2 Pricing - 3 minutes</a><br>
* On-Demand instances - recommended for when you are starting off with experiments where workloads may be a little unpredictable.

* Reserved Instances - recommended for stable workloads, which can be secured over a 1 to 3 year term.  These are the cheapest per second of billing.

* Spot Instances - these are instances that you can bid for, and if you are successful you get to use them for a period of time.  Perfect for time critical workloads.  

* Dedicated - a dedicated physical server, recommended for when you have to licence per server to save costs or for clear, compelling compliance reasons.  These are the most expensive per second of billing.<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljYH5lHQdxo&t=2s"> Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a> <br>
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage that can be attached to Amazon EC2 instances.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_Lg2lzTYI">IOPS</a><br>
IOPS stands for Input/Output Operations Per Second. It is a common performance measurement used to test computer storage devices like HDD or SSD etc. In other words, IOPS is a value that specifies how many reads and writes can be made to a disk per second.<br>
It is the measure of no. of I/O operations a drive, SSD or HDD, will handle per second with each block being read form or written to a RANDOM location of a the disk.<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_Lg2lzTYI"> THROUGHPUT</a><br>
Throughput is the value that specifies how many MB of data transfer per second is allowed to a storage system. It is the sequential transfer rate whih an SSD or HDD will maintain continuously.<br>

## [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html)  

Amazon EBS provides the following volume types, which differ in performance characteristics and price, so that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications. The volumes types fall into these categories:

[Solid state drives (SSD)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#solid-state-drives) — Optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.

[Hard disk drives (HDD)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#hard-disk-drives) — Optimized for large streaming workloads where the dominant performance attribute is throughput.

[Previous generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#ebs-previous-generation-volumes) — Hard disk drives that can be used for workloads with small datasets where data is accessed infrequently and performance is not of primary importance. We recommend that you consider a current generation volume type instead.

[Storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Storage.html)

Amazon EC2 provides you with flexible, cost effective, and easy-to-use data storage options for your instances. Each option has a unique combination of performance and durability. These storage options can be used independently or in combination to suit your requirements.
